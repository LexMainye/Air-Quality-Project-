##  Air Quality Monitoring in Kenyan Cities üèô üá∞üá™

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the **analysis and visualization of air quality data** for three major Kenyan cities: **Nairobi**, **Mombasa**, and **Kisumu**. Using real-time data from the **OpenWeather API**, we explore pollution trends, conduct statistical and machine learning analysis, and create an interactive **Dash** web dashboard.

## Jupyter Notebook Analysis

The project was carried out in a Jupyter Notebook, which was rendered for interactive exploration and analysis. The following key components were analyzed:

1. **Air Quality Analysis**:
    - Conversion of timestamps.
    - Extraction of pollutant concentrations for different cities.

2. **Data Visualization**:
    - Various plots and figures were created using **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, and **Seaborn**.
    - Detailed comparison graphs for pollutants across cities and over time.

---

## Dashboard Visualization (Rendered in Jupyter Notebook)

I built an **interactive dashboard** using `Dash`:
- Select city, month, and date range
- View daily pollutant levels over time
- Compare monthly pollutant averages
- Explore trends and pollutant behavior

## Machine Learning Insights

### 1. Classification (AQI Levels)
- Used `main.aqi` to classify air quality as `Good`, `Moderate`, `Unhealthy`, etc.
- Algorithms: Decision Trees, Random Forests
- Input features: pollutant concentrations (`co`, `no2`, `pm2_5`, etc.)

### 2. Clustering Analysis
- Applied **KMeans** and **DBSCAN** to find pollution pattern clusters by time and location
- Helped identify peak pollution hours and typical pollutant profiles per city

### 3. Anomaly Detection
- Used **Multivariate Outlier Detection** and **AUC Score** methods
- Detected unusual spikes in pollutants like `PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ` and `CO` linked to industrial or traffic events

### Background Information to Each city

**Nairobi**

![image alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/796034ef69a4060de4901341553e889f0cbe9c23/Nairobi/Nairobi.jpg)

Nairobi is the capital and largest city of Kenya. The city lies in the south central part of Kenya, at an elevation of 1,795 metres (5,889 ft). The name is derived from the Maasai phrase Enkare Nairobi, which translates to 'place of cool waters', a reference to the Nairobi River which flows through the city. The city proper had a population of 4,397,073 in the 2019 census.

**Mombasa**

![image alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/796034ef69a4060de4901341553e889f0cbe9c23/Mombasa/Mombasa.jpg)

Mombasa ( *mom-BASS-…ô; also US:  -‚Å†BAH-s…ô*) is a coastal city in southeastern Kenya along the Indian Ocean. It was the first capital of British East Africa, before Nairobi was elevated to capital status in 1907. It now serves as the capital of Mombasa County. The town is known as "the white and blue city" in Kenya. It is the country's oldest (c. 900 A.D.) and second-largest city after Nairobi, with a population of about 1,208,333 people according to the 2019 census.
Mombasa's location on the Indian Ocean made it a historical trading centre, and it has been controlled by many countries because of its strategic location.

---

**Kisumu**

![image alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/796034ef69a4060de4901341553e889f0cbe9c23/Kisumu/Kisumu.jpg)

Kisumu ( kee-SOO-moo) is the third-largest city in Kenya located in the Lake Victoria area in the former Nyanza Province. It is the second-largest city after Kampala in the Lake Victoria Basin. The city has a population of slightly over 600,000. The metro region, including Maseno and Ahero, has a population of  1,155,574 people according to the 20189 census. Apart from being an important political city, it is one of the premier industrial and commercial centres in Kenya. It is also an intellectual city with many PhDs.Culturally, Kisumu serves as the centre of the Luo people of East Africa. It was the most prominent urban centre in the pre-colonial and post-colonial period. It remains prominent in the modern era for natives of the Kavirondo region. It was briefly renamed Port Florence, before its name was reverted back.
The city serves as the capital of Kisumu County.

## Data Collection

### Source: [OpenWeather Air Pollution API](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution)
- The dataset contains **90 days** of hourly air quality data.
- Cities Queried: `Nairobi`, `Mombasa`, and `Kisumu`
- Each record includes pollutants like `CO`, `NO`, `NO2`, `O3`, `SO2`, `PM2.5`, `PM10`, and `NH3`.

### Time Handling
- The `dt` column (UNIX timestamp) was **converted into datetime format** for easier analysis and filtering:
```python
import pandas as pd
df['dt'] = pd.to_datetime(df['dt'], unit='s')
```

### Dataset Structure
```python
df.info()
# Output:
# Columns: dt, city, main.aqi, co, no, no2, o3, so2, pm2_5, pm10, nh3
# Rows: 6048 entries (3 cities √ó 90 days √ó hourly data)
```

### üìà Dashboard Results (Built with Dash)

The dashboard was developed using the [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) framework and provides an **interactive web interface** for visualizing air quality data over a 90-day period across **Nairobi**, **Mombasa**, and **Kisumu**.

####  Dashboard Features

1. **City, Month & Date Filter Controls**
   - A dynamic control panel allows users to select:
     - A **city** from the three available (`city-dropdown`)
     - A **specific month** (`month-dropdown`)
     - A **custom date range** (`date-range`)
   - These filters work together to update all plots in real-time.

2. **Daily Pollution Levels**
   - **Graph ID**: `pollution-graph`
   - Displays line charts for **8 pollutants** (`co`, `no`, `no2`, `o3`, `so2`, `pm2_5`, `pm10`, `nh3`) over the selected period.
   - Each line represents a different pollutant‚Äôs hourly concentration.
   - Helps track **pollution spikes** and **multi-pollutant exposure** across time.

3. **Monthly Comparison**
   - **Graph ID**: `monthly-comparison`
   - Shows **monthly average concentration** of a selected pollutant (via `pollutant-dropdown`) for the chosen city.
   - Useful for identifying pollution patterns, seasonal trends, or policy impacts.
   - Bars represent different months, making it easy to spot changes.

4. **üìà Pollutant Trend (Mean, Min, Max)**
   - **Graph ID**: `pollutant-trend`
   - Plots daily **average**, **minimum**, and **maximum** pollutant levels using a line+fill chart.
   - Provides a detailed view of pollutant fluctuation and outliers over time.
   - Helps determine how volatile or stable air quality is in a specific city.

**Explanation:** 

- For the daily air pollution levels plots, carbon monoxide `co` appears to be the dominant pollutant compared to the other pollutants that appear to be in lower concentrations, March records the highest spike in `CO` reaching levels of about `~ 4,000 Œºg/m¬≥`.

**Potential Causes of high CO levels in Nairobi**
1. **Vehicular Emissions** (Traffic, old cars, motorcycles)  
2. **Industrial Activities** (Factories, power plants, informal workshops)  
3. **Domestic Fuel Use** (Charcoal, firewood, kerosene stoves)  
4. **Geographic/Meteorological Traps** (Valley effect, temperature inversions)  
5. **Waste Burning** (Open garbage burning)  
6. **Construction Equipment** (Diesel generators, machinery)

**Recommended Mitigation strategies**
1. Strict vehicle emissions testing  
2. Promote electric/hybrid vehicles  
3. Improve public transport (BRT, cycling lanes)  
4. Phase out old, polluting vehicles  
5. Enforce industrial emission controls  
6. Switch factories to cleaner energy (solar/LPG)  
7. Ban open waste burning  
8. Subsidize clean cooking fuels (LPG/electric stoves)  
9. Public awareness campaigns on CO dangers  
10. Expand air quality monitoring network  
11. Increase urban green spaces  
12. Strict enforcement of anti-pollution laws

### Clustering


**Elbow Method & Cluster Analysis for Air Quality Data**

![image Alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/Elbow%20Plot.png)

**1. Elbow Plot Interpretation**
The plot shows the **inertia** (sum of squared distances to cluster centers) decreasing as the number of clusters (K) increases:

- **Key Observation**:  
  - The "elbow" occurs at **K=3 or K=4** (where inertia reduction slows sharply)  
  - This suggests **3-4 natural groupings** exist in the pollution data  

- **Why It Matters**:  
  - Fewer clusters ‚Üí Broader pollution patterns  
  - More clusters ‚Üí Finer distinctions (e.g., separating industrial vs. traffic pollution)  

 **2. Cluster Means Analysis**
The 5-cluster solution reveals distinct pollution profiles:

| Cluster | CO     | NO‚ÇÇ   | PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ | O‚ÇÉ   | Dominant AQI | Interpretation               |
|---------|--------|-------|-------|------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| **0**   | 379    | 2.5   | 7.6   | 43   | 1-2          | **Clean Days** (Good air)     |
| **1**   | 1,187  | 13.1  | 48.2  | 24   | 3-4          | **Urban Pollution** (Traffic) |
| **2**   | 2,657  | 28.8  | 125.5 | 5    | 5            | **Extreme Events** (Wildfires/Industry) |
| **3**   | 491    | 4.7   | 12.2  | 62   | 2            | **High-Ozone Days**           |
| **4**   | 714    | 6.5   | 22.6  | 24   | 2-3          | **Mixed Sources**             |

**Key Insights**:  
- **Cluster 2** is critical (Hazardous AQI) with extreme PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ (125 Œºg/m¬≥) and CO (2,657 Œºg/m¬≥)  
- **Cluster 3** shows ozone-dominated pollution (62 Œºg/m¬≥) despite moderate other pollutants  

 **3. Cluster-AQI Alignment**
The cross-tabulation reveals:

- **Cluster 0**: Mostly AQI 1-2 (Clean)  
- **Cluster 1**: Primarily AQI 3-4 (Polluted)  
- **Cluster 2**: Exclusively AQI 5 (Hazardous)  
- **Cluster 3**: Mostly AQI 2 (Moderate with ozone)  
- **Cluster 4**: Mixed AQI 2-3 (Transitional)  

**Notable Mismatches**:  
- 6 AQI-2 samples in Cluster 1 ‚Üí Possible sensor errors  
- 1 AQI-4 in Cluster 4 ‚Üí Borderline case  

   -
 **4. Scientific Implications**
- **Cluster 2** matches known extreme event signatures (e.g., wildfire smoke)  
- **Cluster 3** shows ozone production inversely correlates with NO‚ÇÇ (titration effect)  
- **Cluster 0-1** gradient reflects urban pollution accumulation  

This analysis confirms that **3-4 dominant emission regimes** exist in the data, with clear links to AQI categories. The elbow plot suggests K=4 might be optimal for balancing granularity and simplicity.

### Cluster of Pollution Profiles

![Image Alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/Cluster%20of%20Pollution%20Profiles.png)

**Key Insights from the Plot**

1. **Separation of Pollution Profiles**:
   - The plot visually confirms the three distinct pollution profiles:
     - **`Cluster 0` (left, dark purple)**: Low pollution, associated with cleaner air (but higher ozone).
     - **`Cluster 1` (middle, Green)**: Moderate pollution, a transitional group between low and high pollution.
     - **`Cluster 2 `(right, yellow)**: Severe pollution, likely from industrial or vehicular emissions.

2. **PCA Components**:
   - **`PCA Component 1`** (x-axis) seems to capture the overall pollution intensity, as Cluster 2 (highest pollution) is on the far right, Cluster 0 (lowest pollution) is on the far left, and Cluster 1 (moderate) is in between.
   - **`PCA Component 2`** (y-axis) might be influenced by specific pollutants like ozone (O3), which is higher in Cluster 0, or other factors that differentiate pollution profiles within the same overall intensity level.

3. **Cluster Density and Spread**:
   - `Cluster 0` is the most densely packed, suggesting that many samples fall into the "cleaner air" category.
   - `Cluster 2` is the least dense, indicating that fewer samples exhibit such extreme pollution levels.
   - `Cluster 1`‚Äôs spread and overlap with the other clusters reflect its role as a "middle ground" with more variability in pollution profiles.

4. **Alignment with AQI**:
   - The plot‚Äôs separation along PCA Component 1 mirrors the AQI distribution:
     - Left `Cluster 0` ‚Üí Good/Moderate AQI.
     - Middle `Cluster 1` ‚Üí Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, with some Unhealthy/Very Unhealthy.
     - Right `Cluster 2` ‚Üí Very Unhealthy AQI.

5. **Clustering Quality**:
   - The moderate silhouette score (0.452) is reflected in the plot: while Clusters 0 and 2 are relatively distinct, Cluster 1 shows some overlap with both, indicating that the boundaries between clusters are not perfectly sharp.

**Conclusion**

This scatter plot effectively visualizes the clustering of pollution profiles after PCA reduction. It confirms the interpretation of the clusters as representing **`low (Cluster 0)`**, **`moderate (Cluster 1)`**, and **`severe (Cluster 2)`** pollution levels, with `PCA Component 1` largely capturing the gradient of pollution intensity. The alignment with AQI categories further validates the clustering, and the moderate silhouette score explains the slight overlaps observed, particularly for `Cluster 1`.

### Cluster Heatmap

![Image Alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/Cluster%20Heatmap.png)

**Key Insights from the Heatmap**

1. **Pollution Gradient Across Clusters**:
   - The heatmap clearly shows a gradient of pollution levels:
     - **`Cluster 0`** (cleaner air): Low concentrations of most pollutants, except for O3.
     - **`Cluster 1`** (moderate pollution): Intermediate concentrations, acting as a transitional group.
     - **`Cluster 2`** (highly polluted): Extremely high concentrations of most pollutants, except for O3.

2. **Ozone Anomaly**:
   - Ozone (O3) is highest in `Cluster 0` (43.1 ¬µg/m¬≥) and lowest in `Cluster 2` (5.3 ¬µg/m¬≥), which is expected due to the inverse relationship between ozone and NO in polluted environments. In `Cluster 2`, high NO levels (14.6 ¬µg/m¬≥) likely deplete ozone through titration.

3. **Health Implications**:
   - **`Cluster 0`**: Generally safe air quality, though elevated ozone levels could pose risks for sensitive groups during high-sunlight conditions.
   - **`Cluster 1`**: Moderate health risks, particularly for sensitive groups, due to elevated PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 levels.
   - **`Cluster 2`**: Severe health risks due to extremely high levels of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO, and NO2, which can cause respiratory and cardiovascular issues.

4. **Sources of Pollution**:
   - **`Cluster 2`**‚Äôs high levels of CO, NO, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 suggest significant contributions from vehicular and industrial emissions.
   - **`Cluster 1`** may represent urban areas with moderate traffic or industrial activity.
   - **`Cluster 0`** likely represents less urbanized or cleaner areas, with higher ozone possibly due to natural formation in the presence of sunlight and lower NO levels.

5. **Clustering Quality**:
   - The distinct color differences across clusters in the heatmap support the moderate separation indicated by the silhouette score (0.452). While there‚Äôs a clear progression in pollutant levels, the relatively small differences in some pollutants (e.g., SO2, NH3) between clusters may contribute to the slight overlaps seen in the scatter plot.

**Conclusion**

The heatmap provides a clear visual summary of the average pollution levels across the three clusters, confirming the earlier interpretations:

- **`Cluster 0`** represents cleaner air with low pollutant levels (except for O3), aligning with `"Good"` and `"Moderate"` AQI levels.
- **`Cluster 1`** represents moderate pollution, with intermediate pollutant levels and a mix of AQI categories, primarily `"Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups."`
- **`Cluster 2`** represents highly polluted conditions, with extremely high pollutant levels and `"Very Unhealthy"` AQI levels, likely driven by industrial or vehicular emissions.

  ### Cluster Distribution by City
  ![Image Alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/Cluster%20Distribution%20by%20City%20.png)

**Analysis of the Histogram**

**Nairobi**

**Interpretation**:
  - Nairobi predominantly falls into **`Cluster 0`** ("Cleaner" air), indicating mostly "Good" or "Moderate" air quality.
  - A smaller portion is in **`Cluster 1`** ("Moderate" pollution), suggesting occasional "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" conditions.
  - A very small number of samples are in **`Cluster 2`** ("Highly polluted"), indicating rare instances of severe pollution.

**Mombasa**

**Interpretation**:

  - Mombasa has the vast majority of its samples in **`Cluster 0`**, suggesting the best air quality among the three cities, with predominantly "Good" or "Moderate" AQI levels.
  - The negligible presence of **`Cluster 1`** and **`Cluster 2`** indicates that moderate and severe pollution are extremely rare in Mombasa.

**Kisumu**

**Interpretation**:
  - Kisumu‚Äôs samples are split between **`Cluster 0`** ("Cleaner" air) and **`Cluster 1`** ("Moderate" pollution).
  - Most of Kisumu‚Äôs samples are in `Cluster 0`, indicating that the majority of the time, Kisumu experiences "Good" or "Moderate" air quality.
  - The remaining samples are in `Cluster 1`, suggesting that Kisumu experiences moderate pollution levels a notable portion of the time, likely corresponding to "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" AQI levels, with some potential for "Moderate", conditions within `Cluster 1`.


**Conclusion**

- **Mombasa** has the best air quality, with nearly all samples in `Cluster 0` ("Cleaner" air), corresponding to "Good" and "Moderate" AQI levels.
- **Nairobi** also has generally good air quality, predominantly in `Cluster 0`, but with some `Cluster 1` and a few `Cluster 2` samples, indicating occasional moderate to severe pollution.
- **Kisumu** has a mix of air quality levels, with 75% of samples in Cluster 0 ("Cleaner" air) and 25% in `Cluster 1` ("Moderate" pollution). This means Kisumu‚Äôs air quality is mostly "Good" or "Moderate," with occasional "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" conditions, but it does **not** experience the "Very Unhealthy" levels associated with `Cluster 2`.

### Silhouette Plot

![Image Alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/Silhouette%20plot%20per%20sample.png)

**Key Insights from the Silhouette Plot**

1. **Moderate Clustering Quality**:
   - The average silhouette score of 0.45 indicates moderate clustering quality, which is visually confirmed by the plot. Most samples have positive silhouette coefficients (0.2 to 0.6), suggesting that the clusters are reasonably distinct, but the presence of lower and negative values indicates some overlap, particularly for Cluster 1.

2. **Cluster Separation**:
   - **`Cluster 0`** (likely the largest band) has many samples with silhouette coefficients around 0.4 to 0.6, reflecting its distinct position in the scatter plot (low pollution) and its large size (3750 samples).

   - **`Cluster 1`** (likely a smaller band) has more samples with lower coefficients (near 0 or slightly negative), reflecting its transitional nature and overlap with Clusters 0 and 2, as seen in the scatter plot.

   - **`Cluster 2`** (likely the smallest band) has a mix of coefficients, with some high values due to its distinctness (high pollution) but some lower values due to overlap with Cluster 1.

3. **Potential Misclassifications**:
   - The small number of negative silhouette coefficients (around -0.1) suggests that a few samples may be misclassified, particularly in Cluster 1, which acts as a transitional group. These samples might be better assigned to `Cluster 0` or `Cluster 2`, depending on their pollutant profiles.

4. **Consistency with Previous Analyses**:
   - The silhouette plot aligns with the scatter plot‚Äôs observation of slight overlaps, particularly for `Cluster 1`, which is positioned between Clusters 0 and 2 in the PCA space.
   - The heatmap‚Äôs distinct pollution profiles (especially between Clusters 0 and 2) support the higher silhouette coefficients for these clusters, while Cluster 1‚Äôs intermediate levels explain its lower coefficients.
   - The cluster distribution by city (e.g., Kisumu having only Clusters 0 and 1) is reflected in the plot, as Cluster 2‚Äôs small size (20 samples) and absence in Kisumu contribute to its small band.


**Conclusion**

The silhouette plot, with an average silhouette score of 0.45, confirms that the K-means clustering (K=3) on your pollution data resulted in moderately well-separated clusters. Most samples have positive silhouette coefficients, indicating that they are generally well-assigned to their clusters, but the presence of lower and negative values reflects some overlap, particularly for `Cluster 1` ("Moderate" pollution), which acts as a transitional group between `Cluster 0` ("Cleaner" air) and `Cluster 2` ("Highly polluted"). This aligns with the scatter plot‚Äôs visualization of overlaps, the heatmap‚Äôs intermediate pollution levels for `Cluster 1`, and the cluster distribution by city, where cities like Kisumu lack `Cluster 2` entirely.

### DBSCAN Silhouette 

| Metric               | Value                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DBSCAN Silhouette** | -0.26                                                                |

  ### K-Distance Plot for eps Estimation
  
  ![image alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Clustering%20%26%20Clustering%20Techniques/K-Distance%20Plot%20for%20eps%20estimation.png)

  **Interpretation:**

The plot shows the sorted distances to the 5th nearest neighbor for each point. The goal is to identify an "elbow" point, where the distances start to increase rapidly. This elbow suggests a good eps value for DBSCAN, as it represents the transition from dense regions (where points are close to their neighbors) to sparse regions (where points are farther apart).

**Observation:**

For the first ~4000 points, the 5th nearest neighbor distance is very small (close to 0, around 0 to 0.5). This indicates that most points in the dataset are in dense regions, where points are very close to their 5th nearest neighbor.
Around 4000 points, the distance starts to increase gradually, and after ~5000 points, it rises sharply, reaching up to 14.

**Elbow Point:**

The elbow is not very pronounced, but a reasonable elbow point appears to be around the 4000th to 4500th point, where the distance starts to increase more noticeably. At this point, the 5th nearest neighbor distance is around 0.5 to 1.0.

This suggests that an eps value in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 might be a good starting point for DBSCAN. Points with a 5th nearest neighbor distance less than this value are likely in dense regions (potential clusters), while points with larger distances are in sparser regions (potential noise or outliers).

**Implications:**

The k-distance plot indicates that the data has a large dense region (the first ~4000 points with small distances) and a smaller sparse region (the last ~1000 points with rapidly increasing distances). This aligns with the K-means cluster distribution by city, where Cluster 0 ("Cleaner" air) had 3750 samples (dense), Cluster 1 ("Moderate" pollution) had 510 samples (less dense), and Cluster 2 ("Highly polluted") had only 20 samples (very sparse).

An eps value of 0.5 to 1.0 should capture the dense regions as clusters, but points in sparser regions (e.g., Cluster 2 from K-means) might be labeled as noise if their 5th nearest neighbor distance exceeds this value.

### New DBSCAN Silhouette

 **Key Takeaways**
- **Nairobi** is the noisiest city by far, especially early in the week.
- **Kisumu** shows a peak on **Thursday**.
- **Mombasa** isn't as noisy as the rest


### Advanced Anomaly Detection & Pattern Analysis

![image alt](https://github.com/LexMainye/Air-Quality-Project-/blob/main/Anomaly%20Detection%20%26%20Pattern%20Analysis/Pollution%20Hotspots.png)

The map plot effectively shows that Nairobi appears to be a air significant pollution hotspot compared to other cities under observation in Kenya.

Nairobi's status as a significant air pollution hotspot compared to Mombasa and Kisumu can be attributed to several interconnected factors:

 1. **Population Density and Urbanization**
   - Nairobi is Kenya's most densely populated city (over 4.7 million people in the metro area), leading to higher emissions from:
     - Vehicular traffic (congestion is severe)
     - Industrial activity concentrated in the city
     - Domestic fuel use (charcoal, kerosene)
   - Mombasa and Kisumu have lower population densities and less industrial concentration.

 2. **Transportation Emissions**
   - Nairobi has:
     - Heavy reliance on older, poorly maintained vehicles (many diesel-powered)
     - Frequent traffic jams (idling engines increase particulate matter)
     - Limited public transport infrastructure (leads to more private vehicles)
   - Mombasa has more maritime transport (less polluting than road traffic), while Kisumu has fewer vehicles overall.

3. **Industrial Activity**
   - Nairobi hosts Kenya's largest industrial zone (along Mombasa Road and Athi River), including:
     - Manufacturing plants
     - Construction material production (cement, steel)
     - Informal sector activities (e.g., metal recycling)
   - Mombasa's industry is more port-focused, and Kisumu has lighter industry.

 4. **Geographical and Meteorological Factors**
   - Nairobi's **high altitude (~1,800m)** reduces air dispersion, trapping pollutants.
   - The city sits in a **valley**, limiting wind circulation that could disperse pollution.
   - Mombasa's coastal location benefits from sea breezes that disperse pollutants.
   - Kisumu's proximity to Lake Victoria also allows for better air mixing.

5. **Energy and Fuel Use**
   - **Nairobi:**
     - Heavy use of diesel generators during power outages
     - Widespread charcoal burning in informal settlements
     - Industrial reliance on heavy fuel oils
   - **Mombasa/Kisumu:**
     - More access to cleaner energy (e.g., Mombasa's proximity to the Kipevu power plant)
     - Less reliance on backup generators

 6. **Construction and Dust**
   - Nairobi's rapid construction boom generates significant dust (PM2.5/PM10).
   - Unpaved roads in informal settlements exacerbate particulate pollution.
   - Mombasa and Kisumu have slower construction growth.

7. **Waste Burning**
   - Open burning of waste is common in Nairobi's informal settlements (Dandora, Kibera).
   - Mombasa and Kisumu have smaller-scale waste disposal issues.

8. **Policy and Enforcement Gaps**
   - Nairobi's pollution regulations are poorly enforced (e.g., vehicle emissions testing).
   - County governments in Mombasa and Kisumu may have better localized controls.

Mitigation Insights:
To reduce Nairobi's pollution, priorities could include:
- Upgrading public transport (e.g., BRT systems)
- Stricter vehicle emissions standards
- Promoting cleaner industrial technologies
- Expanding green spaces to improve air circulation.

Mombasa and Kisumu's relatively lower pollution levels highlight how coastal/breeze-accessible cities can benefit from natural dispersion, but they may face future risks if industrialization grows unchecked.

   - Strongest ties to PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ (r=0.91), PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ (r=0.91), NO (r=0.82), and NO‚ÇÇ (r=0.74).  
   - *Interpretation*: CO spikes signal **combustion events** (burning, traffic, industry).  

2. **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ-PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ Bond (r=0.97)**:  
   - Near-perfect correlation ‚Üí Fine and coarse particles share common sources.  

3. **NO-NO‚ÇÇ-CO Triangle**:  
   - NO/NO‚ÇÇ correlations with CO (r=0.74‚Äì0.82) ‚Üí **Traffic/fuel combustion fingerprint**.  

 **2. Kenyan Context for These Correlations**

**A. CO-Linked Patterns**  

| Correlation | Kenyan Scenario | Example Locations |
|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|

  - Shared sources:  
    - **Urban**: Vehicle brake/tire wear (Nairobi CBD).  
    - **Rural**: Agricultural tilling + savanna fires (Narok).  

**C. Nitrogen Oxides**  
- **NO ‚Üî NO‚ÇÇ (via CO)**:  
  - **Traffic hotspots**:  
    - Mombasa port truck queues.  
    - Nairobi‚Äôs Globe Roundabout.  


 **3. Policy Implications**

**Nairobi-Specific**  
- **Targeted Measures**:  
  - **Thika Road**: Enforce Euro 5 standards for trucks.  
  - **Industrial Area**: Mandate CO scrubbers in factories.  

**Mombasa-Specific**  
- **Port Actions**:  
  - Replace diesel forklifts with electric models.  
  - Real-time NO‚ÇÇ monitoring at KPA gates.  

**Kisumu-Specific**  
- **Agricultural Controls**:  
  - Promote non-burning sugarcane harvesting.  
  - Penalize nighttime field burning.

 **4. Scientific Insights**  

- **Combustion Signature**: High CO-PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ-NO‚Çì correlations confirm **incomplete fuel burning** dominates extremes.  
- **Traffic vs. Industry**:  
  - **NO-dominant**: Traffic (matatus, trucks).  
  - **CO-dominant**: Industry/waste burning.  

 **Conclusion**  
1. **CO is the keystone pollutant** during extremes ‚Üí it should be monitored closely.  
2. **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ-PM‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ pairing** demands integrated dust/fire controls.  
3. **City-specific strategies** should break these correlation chains.

   - *Kenya Context*: Matches construction dust (Athi River).  

2. **Feature 1 (Likely CO)**:  
   - **Moderate positive impact**.  
   - *Interpretation*: CO spikes from traffic/industry raise AQI predictions.  
   - *Kenya Context*: Matatu congestion (Nairobi CBD), waste burning (Dandora).  

3. **Feature 6 (Possibly O‚ÇÉ)**:  
   - **Negative impact** (left bar).  
   - *Interpretation*: High O‚ÇÉ sometimes lowers AQI predictions (due to NOx titration in cities).  
   - *Kenya Context*: Sunny days in Karen (low NOx) vs. industrial zones (high NOx).  

 **Less Important Features**  
- **Feature 0/7 (e.g., NH‚ÇÉ, SO‚ÇÇ)**:  
  - Minimal impact ‚Üí Less critical for AQI predictions in your model.

**3. Policy Implications**  

**Prioritize Reducing Top Pollutants**  
1. **PM‚ÇÇ.‚ÇÖ (Feature 4)**:  
   - **Nairobi**: Enforce dust control at construction sites.  
   - **Kisumu**: Ban sugarcane field burning.  

2. **CO (Feature 1)**:  
   - **Mombasa**: Retrofit port trucks to Euro 6 standards.  
   - **Nairobi**: Phase out charcoal stoves in informal settlements.  
   
 **Monitor O‚ÇÉ (Feature 6) Paradox**  
- **Action**: Deploy more NOx sensors in high-O‚ÇÉ suburbs (e.g., Karen, Runda).
